# Programming Constructs:

1. Branching - if-else











**NOTE:**
- 3 + 5
- Operator - +
- Operand - 3, 5
- Unary Operator - 1 operand
- Binary Operator - 2 operands
- Ternary Operator - 3 operands
- ?: - Ternary Operator ---> when we want to return values

# Scope of a Variable:
The scope of a variable is defined as the area or region of a program 
where it can be accessed. 
* local scope *
* global scope (java has no global scope) *

* on the basis of *
1. where it is declared/defined
2. owenership

### Access Modifiers
- Public   (Access from anywhere)
- Private  (Only same class)
- Protected(same class & shild class)
- <Default>

- int number = 4;  // Static/Non-Static
- void print() {
   int number = 5;   // local variable
}



#### Local VAriable Type Inference: 

** Staticaly-Typed Language: (data type must be defined) **
->c, c++, Java
- int number = 4;

** Dynamically-Typed Language: (data type can be inferred)**
-> python
- number = 4;


## Reference Type in Java -> Infinity 

-**Data: ** values related to any object
-**Type: ** info about something and some operations on it
            - int -> [-x to x-1] (data), +,-,*,/
